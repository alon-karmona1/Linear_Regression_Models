Linear Regression Modeling Course - A Project in Statistical Analysis of Databases

In this project I will perform a formal analysis of the database:

1. Pre-processing -
Defining the variables (definition of each variable and its units of measure, its range of values and whether it is continuous or categorical), removal of variables (variables which in my opinion have no correlation between them and the explained variable), adjustment of variables - (categorization / transformation of variable), Defining dummy variables (for categorical variables, I will define the appropriate binary variables), Adding interaction variables for dummy variables (selected from a sample of certain interaction variables).

2. Adjusting the model and checking the model assumptions:
Selecting the model variables (different criteria and algorithms for selecting the model), testing the model assumptions (testing different assumptions, assuming the normality of errors, testing the linear assumption), giving an example of using the selected model, performing a hypothesis test based on the model results, and testing the model(If I should add transformation variables or replace an existing variable in the transformation of that variable, and re-examine variables that have been omitted from the model, which may contribute to the explanation of the explained variable).
